## Git Hook Scripts to ensure commit message header format

### commit-msg Hook (local)
* ensure `node` and `npx` command is installed on your local machine
* create following file in your local repository folder`.git-hooks/commit-msg`
  ```shell
  #!/usr/bin/env sh
  
  commit_message="$1"
  # exit with a non zero exit code incase of an invalid commit message
  
  # use git-conventional-commits, see https://github.com/qoomon/git-conventional-commits
  npx git-conventional-commits commit-msg-hook "$commit_message"
  
  # or verify $commit_message with your own tooling
  # ...
  
  ```
* ⚠ make `.git-hooks/commit-msg` executable (unix: `chmod +x '.git-hooks/commit-msg'`)
* set git hook directory to `.githooks`  `git config core.hooksPath '.git-hooks'`
* commit `.git-hooks` directory if you want to share them with your team, they only need to call the git config command once after cloning the repository

### pre-receive Hook (server side)
* create following file in your repository folder `.git/hooks/pre-receive`
  ```shell
  #!/usr/bin/env bash

  # Pre-receive hook that will block commits with messges that do not follow regex rule

  commit_msg_type_regex='feat|fix|refactor|style|test|docs|build'
  commit_msg_scope_regex='.{1,20}'
  commit_msg_description_regex='.{1,100}'
  commit_msg_regex="^(${commit_msg_type_regex})(\(${commit_msg_scope_regex}\))?: (${commit_msg_description_regex})\$"
  merge_msg_regex="^Merge branch '.+'\$"

  zero_commit="0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

  # Do not traverse over commits that are already in the repository
  excludeExisting="--not --all"

  error=""
  while read oldrev newrev refname; do
    # branch or tag get deleted
    if [ "$newrev" = "$zero_commit" ]; then
      continue
    fi

    # Check for new branch or tag
    if [ "$oldrev" = "$zero_commit" ]; then
      rev_span=`git rev-list $newrev $excludeExisting`
    else
      rev_span=`git rev-list $oldrev..$newrev $excludeExisting`
    fi

    for commit in $rev_span; do
      commit_msg_header=$(git show -s --format=%s $commit)
      if ! [[ "$commit_msg_header" =~ (${commit_msg_regex})|(${merge_msg_regex}) ]]; then
        echo "$commit" >&2
        echo "ERROR: Invalid commit message format" >&2
        echo "$commit_msg_header" >&2
        error="true"
      fi
    done
  done

  if [ -n "$error" ]; then
    exit 1
  fi
  ```
* ⚠ make `.git/hooks/pre-receive` executable (unix: `chmod +x '.git/hooks/pre-receive'`)

=======
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
